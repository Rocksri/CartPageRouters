README: E-Commerce Store with Cart Functionality
Project Overview

This project is a simple e-commerce website that allows users to view a list of products fetched from the Fake Store API, add products to a shopping cart, and manage the cart items. The cart page includes functionalities to increase or decrease item quantities, remove items, and dynamically update the total price. A 10% discount is applied to the total price when the user checks out. The site is fully responsive and implements basic routing between the product listing page and the cart page.
Features

    Cart Page: Displays all products in the cart, showing the product name, price, quantity, and total price for each item.
    Quantity Management: Users can increase or decrease the quantity of each product in the cart, which will dynamically update the total price.
